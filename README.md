### Hey all, I'm Ian ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Utah, where I also completed a Masters of Public Administration. My research interests are at the intersection of public policy and policing, and include body-worn cameras and use-of-force. I teach criminal law (undergraduate) and statistical courses (graduate), and primarily focus on R. I especially love teaching students the beauty of RMarkdown and `tidyverse`, and the varied ways to communicate in those contexts. I was a 2018 American Society of Public Administration Founders' Fellow, and a 2020/2021 doctoral fellow of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. My personal website (and current CV) available at www.ianadamsresearch.com.
