### Hey all, I'm Ian ðŸ‘‹

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina. I received my PhD in political science from the University of Utah, where I also completed a Masters of Public Administration. My research interests are at the intersection of public policy and policing, and include body-worn cameras and use-of-force. I research at the nexus of policing, policy, and technology, with a specific interest in use-of-force and body-worn cameras. I have over twenty peer-reviewed publications on these and related topics, and my peer-reviewed work has been published in the top general interest journals of both criminal justice and public administration. I teach criminal justice, policy, and statistical courses at both the undergradaute and graduate level. In my statistical courses, we primarily focus on R. I especially love teaching students the beauty of RMarkdown and the `tidyverse`, and the varied ways to communicate in those contexts. I was a 2018 American Society of Public Administration Founders' Fellow, and a 2020/2021 doctoral fellow of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. My personal website (and current CV) is available at www.ianadamsresearch.com.
