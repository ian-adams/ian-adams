### Hey all, I'm Ian 👋

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina. I received my PhD in political science from the University of Utah, where I also completed a Masters of Public Administration. My research interests are at the intersection of public policy, technology, and policing. I teach criminal justice, policy, and statistical courses at both the undergradaute and graduate level. My personal website (and current CV) is available at www.ianadamsresearch.com.
